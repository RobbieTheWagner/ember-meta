Setup meta for your Prember/Ember blog to support opengraph, microdata, Facebook, Twitter, Slack etc.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
ember install ember-meta
```

Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This addon supports a config be set with the basic info for your blog, including the `title`,
`description`, and `url`. The `url` should end in a trailing slash. These values will be used as defaults, and 
you can override them by returning different values in your model.

## Global Config

```js
// config/environment.js
ENV['ember-meta'] = {
    description: 'Ramblings about Ember.js, JavaScript, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.',
    imgSrc: 'http://i.imgur.com/KVqNjgO.png',
    siteName: 'Ship Shape',
    title: 'Blog - Ship Shape',
    twitterUsername: '@shipshapecode',
    url: 'https://shipshape.io/blog/'
  };
```

The `title` will be used for both the `<title>` tag of your page, and for `og:title` and `twitter:title`. Similarly, the
description will be used for `description`, `og:description`, and `twitter:description`. You probably are starting to see
a pattern forming here :smiley:.

The global config will be merged with the local config, when you are on a specific post. This allows you to define
sane defaults, while also retaining the flexibility to override each value on a specific post, by defining it on the
`model`.

All of the values, used to populate the meta, are computed properties, on the `head-data` service. This service is 
automatically injected into all routes, and a default head.hbs is provided for you. This should allow a "zero config" 
setup, if your app adheres to the same data formats as we expect.

## Standard Local Config

The `head-data` service expects the data, for the computed properties, to be in the format provided to us by 
ember-cli-markdown-resolver, but you do not need to use it or even use markdown at all, to use this addon.

### Using with ember-cli-markdown-resolver

In this example, we are using [ember-cli-markdown-resolver](https://github.com/willviles/ember-cli-markdown-resolver)
and it automatically will set the front matter values from your markdown as properties on your model, when you grab the file.

The values in my `.md` files look something like this:

```md
---
author: Robert Wagner
authorId: rwwagner90
categories: 
  - ember
  - ember.js
  - ember inspector
date: '2018-04-09'
slug: ember-inspector-the-journey-so-far
title: Ember Inspector - The Journey so Far
---
```

```js
// routes/blog/post.js
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default Route.extend({
  markdownResolver: service(),

  model({ path }) {
    const withoutSlash = !path.endsWith('/') ? path : path.slice(0, -1);
    return this.markdownResolver.file('blog', withoutSlash);
  }
});
```

### Using with a Vanilla Model Hook

You do not have to use the markdown resolver, but your model must return values of the same format, i.e. an author 
name string, a categories array, a slug for the post, a title, etc. It must return the `content` of the post, as
the `content` property of your model object, and all the other various things as `attributes`. An example of the
same blog post from the markdown example, except using a POJO as the model, is below.

```js
// routes/blog/post.js
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

export default Route.extend({
  model() {
    return {
      content: '<h1>Ember Inspector - The Journey so Far</h1> <p>This is a post body!</p>',
      attributes: {
        author: 'Robert Wagner',
        authorId: 'rwwagner90',
        categories: ['ember', 'ember.js', 'ember inspector'],
        date: '2018-04-09',
        slug: 'ember-inspector-the-journey-so-far',
        title: 'Ember Inspector - The Journey so Far'
      }
    };
  }
});
```

## Advanced Local Config

### Overriding Service Computed Properties

Since all of this is powered by computed properties, in the `head-data` service. You can create your own head-data service, and 
extend the one we provide to override the computeds for various meta to do whatever you want.

```js
// services/head-data.js
import HeadDataService from 'ember-meta/services/head-data';
import { computed } from '@ember/object';

export default HeadDataService.extend({
  description: computed('foo', function() {
    return this.get('foo.description');
  })
});
```

### Defining Your Own head.hbs

A default `head.hbs` is automatically available to your app, but we also provide a blueprint, if you would like to manage the 
content yourself. This allows you to either define your own or delete it altogether and use the one we ship with this addon.
